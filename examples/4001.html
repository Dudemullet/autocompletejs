<p>You can force the user to pick from a list, allow free-form input, or do a hybrid with <a href="docs#list_object:allowFreeform"><code class="js plain">allowFreeform</code></a>.</p>
<p>In this example we have mandatory choices for breakfast, suggestions for lunch (but you can type in anything you want), and anything goes for dinner.</p>
<p>Allowing the user to enter free-form text is disabled by default.</p>
