<p>You can completely remove the widget from the DOM with the <a href="docs#methods:destroy"><code class="js plain">destroy</code></a> method.</p>
<p>Calling destroy is not reversible. You will have to re-initialize the widget if you want to see it again.</p>
<div id="search_bar"></div>
<input type="button" id="destroyBtn" class="button radius demo-btn" value="Destroy the widget" />
