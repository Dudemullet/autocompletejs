<p>Use the <a href="docs#list_object:matchOptions"><code class="js plain">matchOptions</code></a> property to define a custom matching function.</p>
<p>The function should return an array of <a href="docs#option_object"><code class="js plain">Option Objects</code></a>.</p>
<p>In this example, we're allowing the user to match on exact PLU code in addition to the regular text search.</p>
<p>Note that this example is kind of silly, it would be a much better user experience to include the PLU code on the <a href="docs#list_object:optionHTML"><code class="js plain">optionHTML</code></a> if we wanted to allow the user to match against it.</p>
